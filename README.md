Integrated with HalluDesign, the CoDP model serves as a fast, distogram-based ranking tool. It leverages contrastive learning to quickly screen sequences by their predicted structural compatibility, facilitating a more efficient design cycle. This capability directly enhances the stability of monomeric proteins and improves the specificity of protein-ligand interactions.

# Installation
if your are installing HalluDesign, you no need to install in this way.
